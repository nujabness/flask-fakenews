Similar in terms of hardware and features, but different in terms of size, so far the new handsets look like they are worthy follow-ups to an excellent albeit niche smartphone lineup. We already know how the Pixel and the Pixel XL fare in terms of hardware specs and pricing (the Pixel XL is starting at $649), but how does the duo fare against the contemporary crop of flagships size-wise? Well, a couple of days ago we came up with a neat preliminary size comparison between the new Pixels and Google's latest Nexus devices, but now that we have official data it's time for an official size comparison. As usual, we are here to deliver - our size comparison tool is primed and ready to serve you! First of all, let's see how the 5\" Pixel stacks up against the competition. 5.66 x 2.74 x 0.34 inches 143.84 x 69.54 x 8.58 mm 5.04 oz (143 g) 5.79 x 2.86 x 0.31 inches 147 x 72.6 x 7.9 mm 4.80 oz (136 g) 6.27 x 3.06 x 0.29 inches 159.3 x 77.8 x 7.3 mm 6.28 oz (178 g) 6.09 x 2.98 x 0.34 inches 154.72 x 75.74 x 8.6 mm 5.93 oz (168 g) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-04T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-04T21:26:33.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
