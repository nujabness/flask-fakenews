Seul le parti prokurde du HDP (Parti démocratique du peuple) s'est opposé à cette prolongation, souhaitée par le gouvernement. \nCompte tenu de la majorité dont dispose l'AKP au Parlement, l'issue du vote faisait peu de doute. \nLa Turquie dispose de troupes en Irak dans la base de Bashiqa, dans la province de Ninive, pour entraîner des volontaires irakiens sunnites en vue d'une reconquête de Mossoul, deuxième ville d'Irak tombée aux mains de l'EI en juin 2014. \nLe président turc Recep Tayyip Erdogan a indiqué samedi dans un discours prononcé à l'occasion de la rentrée parlementaire que l'offensive militaire avait initialement pour objectif de créer \"une zone de sécurité sans organisations terroristes\", d'environ 5.000 kilomètres. \nDurant son discours d'une quarantaine de minutes, le dirigeant turc s'est félicité de la réussite de l'offensive dans la ville syrienne de Jarablos. Il a affirmé que de nombreux Syriens étaient revenus y vivre depuis qu'elle avait été reprise à l'EI et que la population était passée de 2 000 à 40 000.
